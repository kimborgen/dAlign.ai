Today, the alignment and steering of Artificial Intelligence are influenced by a select few, which shape AI's biases, values, and interpretations. We aim to democratize the alignment process to address this, inviting individuals from all cultures, beliefs, and associations. Our goal is to ensure AI represents all of humanity, not just a privileged few. This involves creating diverse, highly curated datasets of labelled prompt-answer pairs for refining AI models. By harnessing the global, decentralized, and permissionless nature of Web3 systems, we are focused on establishing consensus on the most controversial topics, which demand input from a broad and diverse demographic.
